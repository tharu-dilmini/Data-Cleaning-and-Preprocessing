##  Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Handling Missing Values
| Column     | Strategy               |
|------------|------------------------|
| `children` | Filled with 0          |
| `agent`    | Filled with 0          |
| `company`  | Filled with 0          |
| `country`  | Filled with mode or 'Unknown' |

### 2. Duplicate Removal
- Removed 37 exact duplicates
- Removed near-duplicates by ignoring time-based variations

### 3. Outlier Treatment
- Used IQR and Z-Score methods
- Capped extreme values in `adr`, `lead_time`, and guest counts

### 4. Inconsistency Fixes
- Standardized categorical values like `country` and `meal`
- Parsed and validated date fields (arrival and reservation dates)
- Removed rows where `adults + children + babies == 0`

### 5. Data Integrity Checks
- Ensured total guests > 0
- Validated arrival dates between Jan 2015 and Sep 2017
- Checked that all categorical fields have valid values

## Assumptions Made
- Missing `children`, `agent`, and `company` imply zero
- Country missing values can be 'Unknown'
- ADR outliers reflect errors or rare prices
- 0 guests means invalid booking and was removed
